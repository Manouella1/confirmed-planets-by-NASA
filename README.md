This was my second project using purely Native JavaScript, HTML CSS. No frameworks, just pure JavaScript with some infinity loops along the process. My computer and I survived :)

Task was to fetch data present data from an API of your choice.

I chose NASA's Exoplanet archive. Every confirmed planet and their filters. Get's updated every time a new planet is found.

Biggest planets: compares the biggest found planets in the universe with earth in a bubble graph. Loops through every planet to get updated info every time.

Cities API: Had to include an API to do a POST, PUT and DELETE
